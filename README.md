## Hi there 👋

### Welcome to my journey! 

From Pharmacist, giving meds :pill: to becoming a Web Developer :computer:! Its a journey worth looking at...:arrow_right:

Currently I am completing a Web Development Bootcamp with HyperionDev where I am learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.

During these 16 weeks, as part of course tasks I have been creating multple programs and modules that you will be able to look at below, first one being he Country Data API program wheree you can view live population, elevation and temperature data for Cape Town in South Africa.

**Keep track of my page to see my new projects!**
